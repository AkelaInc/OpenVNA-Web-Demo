## AKELA Web-OpenVNA

This is the source for the AKELA OpenVNA Web-based demonstration.

The demo shows how easily it is to integrate a AKELA VNA into a complex application, in this case a HTML-5 based frontend for the instrument, complete with realtime updating and support for simultaneous viewing and control from multiple concurrent clients.

The underlying VNA API is fully supported on both Python2 and Python3, though this demo is python 3 only.
