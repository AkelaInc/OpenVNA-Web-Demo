## AKELA Web-OpenVNA

This is the source for the AKELA OpenVNA Web-based demonstration.

The demo shows how easy it is to integrate an AKELA VNA into a complex application, in this case a HTML-5 based front-end for the instrument, complete with real-time updating and support for simultaneous viewing and control from multiple concurrent clients.

The underlying VNA API is fully supported on both Python2 and Python3, though this demo is Python 3 only.
